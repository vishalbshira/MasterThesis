<b>Problem statement:</b>
Implementation of automated multi city price prediction machine learning model for the apartments listed on Airbnb.

Description:
The model contains data from various cities of the Europe, which will be used to train the machine learning model. The data will be collected from various data sources majorly from Inside Airbnb website, which contains the detailed information of the hotels all over the world. The model will use the data to predict the prices. In this complete process, many crucial steps will be performed such as: data collection, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, predicting the prices using multiple algorithms, comparing the results, validating the predicted price, evaluating the results and finally deploying the solution on the cloud environment. The model will be designed in such a way that it will be very generic independent of cities. After completing the deployment phase, it will be automated completely.

Benefits: 
 Reduce efforts of setting the prices manually  Efforts of analyzing competitors price will not be required anymore  Generating more revenue for the company

Results: 
Predict the prices for the hotels
